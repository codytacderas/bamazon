1. Firing up node bamazonCustomer.js file should start the store.

2. A list of all the items will appear. The syntax is 'item name,' 'department name,' 'price of item,' and 'items in stock.' 

3. The list will be followed by an inquirer prompt asking which item you would like to buy. You must type in the item name exactly as it appears to have your desired item recognized.

4. You will then be prompted on the quantity you wish to purchase. Your claim will be denied if the desired amount is greater than the items in stock.

5. If the number is valid (claim is less than items in stock), then the item will be purchased and deducted from the items in stock.
